abstract="Known challenges for petascale machines are that (1) the costs of I/O for high performance applications can be substantial, especially for output tasks like checkpointing, and (2) noise from I/O actions can inject undesirable delays into the runtimes of such codes on individual compute nodes. This paper introduces the flexible `DataStager' framework for data staging and alternative services within that jointly address (1) and (2). Data staging services moving output data from compute nodes to staging or I/O nodes prior to storage are used to reduce I/O overheads on applications' total processing times, and explicit management of data staging offers reduced perturbation when extracting output data from a petascale machine's compute partition. Experimental evaluations of DataStager on the Cray XT machine at Oak Ridge National Laboratory establish both the necessity of intelligent data staging and the high performance of our approach, using the GTC fusion modeling code and benchmarks running on 1000+ processors.",

abstract = {Abstract The considerable interest in the high performance computing (HPC) community regarding analyzing and visualization data without first writing to disk, i. e., in situ processing, is due to several factors. First is an I/O cost savings, where data is analyzed/visualized while being generated, without first storing to a filesystem. Second is the potential for increased accuracy, where fine temporal sampling of transient analysis might expose some complex behavior missed in coarse temporal sampling. Third is the ability to use all available resources, CPU's and accelerators, in the computation of analysis products. This STAR paper brings together researchers, developers and practitioners using in situ methods in extreme-scale HPC with the goal to present existing methods, infrastructures, and a range of computational science and engineering applications using in situ analysis and visualization.},

abstract = {SUMMARYApplications running on leadership platforms are more and more bottlenecked by storage input/output (I/O). In an effort to combat the increasing disparity between I/O throughput and compute capability, we created Adaptable IO System (ADIOS) in 2005. Focusing on putting users first with a service oriented architecture, we combined cutting edge research into new I/O techniques with a design effort to create near optimal I/O methods. As a result, ADIOS provides the highest level of synchronous I/O performance for a number of mission critical applications at various Department of Energy Leadership Computing Facilities. Meanwhile ADIOS is leading the push for next generation techniques including staging and data processing pipelines. In this paper, we describe the startling observations we have made in the last half decade of I/O research and development, and elaborate the lessons we have learned along this journey. We also detail some of the challenges that remain as we look toward the coming Exascale era. Copyright Â© 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

    abstract = "Monte Carlo integration is firmly established as the basis for most practical realistic image synthesis algorithms because of its flexibility and generality. However, the visual quality of rendered images often suffers from estimator variance, which appears as visually distracting noise. Adaptive sampling and reconstruction algorithms reduce variance by controlling the sampling density and aggregating samples in a reconstruction step, possibly over large image regions. In this paper we survey recent advances in this area. We distinguish between ``a priori'' methods that analyze the light transport equations and derive sampling rates and reconstruction filters from this analysis, and ``a posteriori'' methods that apply statistical techniques to sets of samples to drive the adaptive sampling and reconstruction process. They typically estimate the errors of several reconstruction filters, and select the best filter locally to minimize error. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of recent state-of-the-art techniques, and provide visual and quantitative comparisons. Some of these techniques are proving useful in real-world applications, and we aim to provide an overview for practitioners and researchers to assess these approaches. In addition, we discuss directions for potential further improvements."
